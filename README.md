## Power BI Excel Data Loading and Visualization Project
Welcome to the README file for Project 3 of the Finlatics Business Analysis Experience Program. In this project, you will be working with Power BI to analyze and visualize data. The tasks involved in this project are outlined below.

### Task:

1. Load the Excel data onto Power BI: Start by importing the provided Excel data into Power BI. This will serve as the basis for your analysis and visualizations.

2. Transform the data: Clean up the data by removing any blank items or errors from columns. Apply the necessary transformations to ensure data accuracy. Once done, close and apply the changes to the dataset.

3. Create a Tree Map Visual: Use the transformed data to create a Tree Map Visual. This visual will display the data of country and sales. Implement the Top N filters to mark the top 3 countries with the highest sales. Assign the colors Blue, Red, and Green to represent these countries.

4. Customize the Tree Map Visual: Enhance the appearance and functionality of the Tree Map Visual using the 'Format your Visual' option. Make adjustments to improve its readability, aesthetics, and overall user experience.

5. Create a Gauge Visual: Build a Gauge Visual to display the average standard cost. Set the color of the Gauge Visual to Blue.

6. Customize the Gauge Visual: Customize and format the Gauge Visual to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Make necessary adjustments to optimize its presentation.

7. Create a Funnel Visual: Utilize the data of Product category and Sales to create a Funnel Visual. This visual will help analyze the sales funnel based on different product categories.

8. Change color of the highest selling product: Identify the highest selling product in the Funnel Visual and change its color to Red. This will provide a clear visual representation of the most successful product.

9. Customize the Funnel Visual: Customize and format the Funnel Visual to enhance its visual appeal and effectiveness. Make any necessary adjustments to optimize the visual's presentation.

10. Create a Line Graph: Generate a Line Graph to visualize the relationship between order quantity and total discount amount. Analyze if there is any correlation between these two quantities.

11. Customize and format the charts into a dashboard: Combine all the created visuals into a comprehensive dashboard. Apply a common color theme and font to maintain visual consistency across the dashboard. Customize and format each visual to ensure a cohesive and professional look.

Feel free to modify and improve the visuals and formatting based on your creativity and analytical insights.
